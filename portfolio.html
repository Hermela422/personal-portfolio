        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Hermela, a third-year computer science student at ACT with a strong passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. Ever since I wrote my first lines of code, I have been fascinated by how software can shape the world. My academic journey has introduced me to various programming languages, algorithms, and technologies that fuel my curiosity and drive to learn more.</p>
        <p>I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think critically and creatively. From developing web applications to exploring artificial intelligence and data structures, I am always eager to expand my skill set. I have also participated in coding competitions and hackathons, which have enhanced my ability to collaborate and solve real-world problems efficiently.</p>
        <p>Beyond academics, I am always looking for opportunities to grow—whether through internships, open-source contributions, or personal projects. My goal is to build innovative solutions that make a difference in people’s lives. I am excited about the future of technology and how I can contribute to it.</p>
